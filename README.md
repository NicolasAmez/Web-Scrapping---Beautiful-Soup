# Web Scraping - Beautiful Soup
In this project, I scraped the Michelin Guide's recommended restaurants from its website using Beautiful Soup and asynchronous functions. The goal was to extract relevant data and create a comprehensive dataset of all Michelin-recommended restaurants in Mexico.

## Python File 
The scraping process was performed using the Beautiful Soup library and asynchronous functions in the [web_scrapping.py](web_scrapping.py) script.

## Output
The extracted data was saved as a CSV dataset: [restaurants_dataset.csv](restaurants_dataset.csv).

## Visualization
The generated dataset was used to create an interactive dashboard showcasing [Michelin Guide in Mexico](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicolas.amezcua/viz/MichelinGuideinMexico/Dashboard1).
